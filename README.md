# Ayoo, friends! ðŸ‘‹ <br> Hope you're doing well ðŸ˜Œ

### A bit about me: 

- ðŸ§  **Data Scientist with a Neuroscience Background**: My focus these days is transforming data into actionable insights, full stop. For over ten years, I pursued neuroscience in academic settings. I still love neuroscience and hope to contribute to the field through my life's work. That said, I'm a data scientist who wants to rigorously follow analyses wherever they logically go. I want to find meaning in the mess and generate predictive models, domain-agnostic. Let's grow our collective knowledge through data!  
  
- ðŸ”­ **Current Focus**: Deepening my knowledge of **machine learning** and diving into **deep learning** techniques. Currently focused on: **PyTorch**, **Language AI**, and **Computer Vision**
  
- ðŸŒ± **Learning Goals**: Expanding my expertise in areas like neural networks, computer vision, RNNs/NLP/transformers, and model interpretability.

- ðŸ’¬ **Let's Chat About**: Machine learning, statistics, Python, neuroscience, or anything data-related.

- ðŸ›  **_Some_ Tools I like to use**: <br>
